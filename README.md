# ECG-and-Accelerometer-Singal-Processing
The goals of this project were to develop a proper understanding of the working principles of both electrocardiograms (ECG) 
and accelerometers, to learn about the unique physiological signals that comprise each time series datasets collected by these two 
sensors, and to develop programming skills in MATLAB in order to process these two signal types collected by the Sensor Dot wearable 
sensor. Results from this project included the visualization of the subjects change in BPM over time, a calculated average BPM, and the 
visualization of the subjects change in respiration rate over time.
